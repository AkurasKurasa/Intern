## Inferred Goal
Precisely fill out a car insurance form using data from an open text file.

## Navigation Rules
- Start at the main application window.
- Minimize any non-essential windows or overlays by clicking on "Minimize" (Step 0).
- Navigate directly to the relevant section labels like "Car Insurance — Data Entry Form", "Drivers", etc. without unnecessary clicks.
- Use keyboard shortcuts for faster movement if available.
- Avoid clicking on unrelated elements such as settings or popups.

## Field Rules
- Click on the appropriate field label to focus it and begin data entry.
- For multi-field entries, ensure all fields are filled out before moving to the next section.
- When entering text, ensure each field is fully populated with the correct data from the text file before proceeding.

## Data Rules
- Read data sequentially from the open text file.
- Use tab-delimited or comma-separated values as appropriate for the form fields.
- Ensure that all required fields are filled out before moving to the next section of the form.

## Edge Cases & Corrections
- If a field is marked as "required" and no value is found in the text file, skip to the next field.
- Handle cases where the text file contains more data than needed for the form by stopping at the last required field.
- For fields that require specific formats (e.g., date, phone number), ensure the values are formatted correctly before entering them.

## Confidence
I am confident that this spec is complete and correct based on the provided traces. However, further testing with additional edge cases will help verify its robustness.
